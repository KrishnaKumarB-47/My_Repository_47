### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```env
GCP_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./path/to/your/service-account-key.json
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### Step 4: Verify Real API Integration
```bash
python check_api_status.py
```
You should see:
